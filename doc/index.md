# Bring your own data to Watson Discovery Service

## Overview

* what is Watson Discovery Service?
* cognitive security as a showcase for bring-your-own-data
* you'll find out how we created this dataset and imported it into Watson Discovery Service
* structured data can be queried
* textual data can be enriched, and those enrichments may be queried

This article provides an example of how you can use the Watson Discovery Service with a dataset of your own.
The Watson Discovery Service can analyse your data and enrich it, as well as letting you query your data using a cognitive search engine.
[Cognitive Security][cog] demonstrates how you can build an application using the Watson Discovery Service with your own dataset.
You'll find out how to prepare a dataset of your own so that it can be imported and enriched by the Discovery service.
And you'll find out how to build a search engine using that dataset.
