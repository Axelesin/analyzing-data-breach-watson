Hackers obtained access to a large swathe of Adobe customer IDs and encrypted passwords & removed sensitive information (i.e. names, encrypted credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates, etc.). Approximately 36 million Adobe customers were involved: 3.1 million whose credit or debit card information was taken and nearly 33 million active users whose current, encrypted passwords were in the database taken. Correction Jan 2015: we previously reported 152m records were taking, but the remainder affected invalid, inactive, test accounts or had out-of-date passwords associated with them.",
